## Detailed Project Specification
https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1131/view

### Application Data and Offline Use

1. Application Data Source

    The client application should pull restaurant data from the development server, parse the JSON response, and use the information to render the appropriate sections of the application UI.

2. Offline Use

    The client application works offline. JSON responses are cached using the IndexedDB API. Any data previously accessed while connected is reachable while offline.

### Responsive Design and Accessibility

1. Responsive Design

    The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports.

2. Accessibility

    The application retains accessibility features from the Stage 1 project. Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, and semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly.

3. Performance

### Site Performance

1. Lighthouse targets for each category exceed:

    Progressive Web App: >90

    Performance: >70
    
    Accessibility: >90
